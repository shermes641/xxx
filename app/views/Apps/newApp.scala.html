                There are many situations where an offer could pay out less than the exchange rate that you are offering - e.g. in the case where an offer pays $0.009 and your currency is worth $0.01.
                In those cases, an option we have is to round up, giving the user 1 Gold even though they didnâ€™t quite earn it.
                If you choose not to enable this option, we will simply not show offers from a provider that has an eCPM below the value of the minimum reward, ensuring in most cases that this does not occur.
