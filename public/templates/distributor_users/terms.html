<br>
2.2	Publisher will install, in accordance with the reasonable directions of Company, Company’s Software Development Kit (“SDK”) as well as any SDKs of any Third Party Ad Providers that will be mediated through the Platform (which may be provided by Company or the applicable Third Party Ad Provider).

<br>
2.3  	Company hereby grants Publisher a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to (i) use, reproduce, display, publish, distribute and transmit the Company Offers (the “Content License”), including any Content (as defined below), trademarks, service marks or logos contained therein, solely through the Service, provided that the Company Offers are used, reproduced, displayed, published, distributed and transmitted exclusively through the Platform, and (ii) use the Platform (the “Platform License”) solely to the extent required to perform its obligations herein, in each case accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In this Agreement, “Content” shall mean artwork, graphics, logos, and copy made available to Publisher for use as part of a Company Offer.
<br>
2.4	Publisher shall not, without prior written authorization from Company in each instance, modify or change the Platform or an Offer, provided however that upon prior notice Publisher may make appropriate adjustments to the placement, size, or rotation of Offers to optimize the efficiency or results of a campaign provided that such adjustment does not degrade or change the physical appearance (other than the size) of, or in any way affect Company’s opt-out, cancel, close, back buttons or other similar user interface elements contained in, the Offer.
<br>
2.5	The Service on which the Offers are placed, directly or indirectly, by Publisher, shall not consist of, or contain, any of the following: (i) sites or applications that are obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, pornographic, profane, indecent, discriminatory against any individual or group, or unlawful; (ii) sites or applications that are factually inaccurate, misleading or deceptive; (iii) sites or applications that facilitate or promote gambling or any type of illegal activity, including without limitation pyramid schemes, or the sale or use of illicit drugs; or (iv) sites or applications that may otherwise damage the goodwill and reputation of Company, as determined by Company in its sole discretion.
<br><br>
3.	Term; Cancellation.
<br><br>
3.1 	This Agreement is effective upon Publisher’s acceptance as set out above and shall continue in full force and effect until terminated.

The Fees shall be reduced to sixty percent (60%) in any month during the first twelve (12) months of the term of this Agreement in which Publisher does not meet the Monthly Threshold, including, without limitation, those months in which Publisher only displays Company Offers, and shall remain at sixty percent (60%) beginning in the second year of the term hereof.

<br>
4.2    	 Publisher or its agents may, with 15 days’ notice but not more than twice in any calendar year, audit Company’s records, which audit will be conducted in a manner designed to minimize any impact on Company’s normal business operations. Company shall pay Publisher any Fees due to Publisher that are identified in the course of such audit. If an audit indicates an underpayment of ten percent (10%) or more of any amounts due hereunder, Company will promptly reimburse Publisher for the reasonable cost of the audit in addition to any amounts otherwise due to Publisher pursuant to this Section 4.2. Publisher’s audit rights will remain in effect for a period ending six (6) months from the termination of the Agreement.

5.3	During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 24 months thereafter, Publisher and its affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any client of Company or its affiliates for itself or any other party, or perform, or participate in the performance of, services for such client or its affiliates other than pursuant to this Agreement; provided that this Section 5.3 shall not apply to a particular service or transaction for which the Publisher shall have secured Company’s written consent in advance.
