Mediation API
=================================

This is the Play 2/Scala application for the Mediation Api.

To get started, open the project in IntelliJ (.idea file already exists).

### Running  (see https://wiki.jungroup.com/display/MED/Environment+Setup for environment and DB setup)

    ./activator -Dconfig.file=conf/production.conf run

### Testing

The current setup requires tests that use browser ChromeDriver to run sequentially

#### Examples of running tests

Run all tests:

    ./activator "it:test" "unit:test" "fun:test" "keen:test"

Run all tests and generates a coverage report

    ./activator clean coverage "it:test" "unit:test" "fun:test" "keen:test" "coverageReport"


Test coverage reports are saved in the */target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report* directory


### Development Gotcha's

If you find yourself adding and removing ad providers you will eventually get some ID values that are not the expected values.
In particular HyprMarketplace is required to have IDs of 2 and 6. These are expected due to environment variables:

     HYPR_MARKETPLACE_AD_PROVIDER_ID         = 2
     HYPR_MARKETPLACE_ANDROID_AD_PROVIDER_ID = 6
     HYPR_MARKETPLACE_IOS_AD_PROVIDER_ID     = 2
