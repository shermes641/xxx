Mediation API
=================================

This is the Play 2 / Scala application for the Mediation Api.

To get started, open the project in IntelliJ (.idea file already exists).

To run/test from the command line, run `./activator`, and then either `run` or `test` from the console.

Additional test configs are avalaible:

// run all tests
./activator "test-only *"

// run all tests except Keen tests
./activator "nokeen:test-only *"

// run all tests in the test/models directory
./activator unit:test

// run all functional tests except Keen tests in the test/functional directory
./activator fun:test

// run all HMAC tests in the test/hmac directory
./activator hmac:test

// run all KEEN tests (tests must start with "Keen" in the test/functional or test/model directories)
./activator keen:test
